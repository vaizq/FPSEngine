# 🔫 3D Game"engine" Prototype (C++ / OpenGL)

This is a early stage 3D "engine" prototype built using **C++** and **OpenGL**.  
The goal was to experiment with building a 3D game with plain old C++ and learn about tech in 3D games.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a work-in-progress / prototype and probably will stay as such.
