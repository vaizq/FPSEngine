# 🔫 3D "Game engine" Prototype (C++ / OpenGL)

This is a early stage 3D "engine" prototype built using **C++** and **OpenGL**.  
I just wanted to better understand the tech used in 3D games/engines so I tried to build my own.
Techniques have been learned from [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorials and [Game Engine Architecture](https://www.gameenginebook.com/) book. Also [tokyospliff](https://www.youtube.com/@tokyospliff) has been a great inspiration.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a work-in-progress / prototype and will probably stay as such.
